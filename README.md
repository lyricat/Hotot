# Hotot
Hotot is a "Lightweight, Flexible Microblogging Client" supporting
Twitter and Identi.ca.

Hotot was previously maintained at [@lyricat/Hotot](https://github.com/lyricat/Hotot),
however that project is no longer being maintained or accepting pull requests.

The intention of this branch is to cut out some of the more superfluous
functionality such as GTK builds and maintain a more basic Hotot into the future.

## Install in Distrubtions:
This branch of Hotot no longer supports installing in distributions. You can
install it in Chrome by loading it as an unpacked extension.

Once this branch is fully tested and considered stable it will be rebranded and
launched in the Chrome Web Store and made available as a desktop installer using
[node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).

Dependencies:
Presently all dependencies are versioned in this repo.
